Property ... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.

What does this Vue warning message mean? Can you safely ignore it? 
What causes it, and how do you fix it?  Write an answer in your own words. 


Answer: It means you are using a Property that does not exsist in Vue data. 
I dont think it will break your code but its likely that something you expect 
to work wont. It is caused by a Property, function, or computed Property that 
doesnt exsist. to fix it you need to define the variable
